Collects, Aggregates, and stores information for later use.


The purpose of this project is to practice solo development of an application that will observe opposing player items and champion choice, calculate a rough estimate of their stats before displaying that data to the user.

We start by amassing the information needed to calculate information starting with the item stats

Then onto item pictures (the means by which the application will recognize what information to use)

Once complete we need the stats for champions (per level) and how passives will affect stats per champion

After the information has been collected, we need to devise a means of recognzing what to retrieve, from where, how to aggregate and how to display the values for the user to see in game
